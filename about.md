Over the years, I've submerged myself in multicultural working enviroment. My area of expertise includes  Social Science, Financial Market and Web development. I hold a Master degree in Econometrics an ongoing PhD. in Demography


I'm currently doing research on labor market outcomes of Canadian born and immigrants in a population aging context. I have extensive research experience in Labor Economics, Computational Demography, and Machine Learning Models.

For my data analysis, I use R predominantly, Stata very often and Python occasionally. I also have a working knowledge of SAS, SPSS and most reporting and visualization tools such as Tableau and Microsoft Office Suite. With these tools, I'm comfortable in performing sophisticated statistical analysis followed by contextual policy or business recommendations.

My earlier graduate training was in econometrics and related statistical analysis technics. However, a passion for programming had led me to start my career as a web developer. For about 5 years in this role, I have developed web programming skills to an expert level.

Underneath these technical skills, is my deep passion for Design, as Steve Job would describe it, that is not only how things look and feel but also how they work. I see in this description the culture and the structure that enable a system to work. I like to view everything in life as nested systems of which we become a collaborator, once we learn the underlying design.
