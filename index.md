# Welcome to my personal blog
Here, I share some of my work that I believe would be of interest to you.
## About Me
I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Montreal, Canada, doing research on labor market outcomes of Canadian born and immigrants in a population aging context.
I have an extensive research experience in Labor Economics, Computational Demography, and Machine Learning Models.

For my data analysis, I use R predominantly, Stata very often and Python occasionally. I also have a working knowledge of SAS, SPSS and most reporting and visualization tools such as Tableau and Microsoft Office Suite. With these tools, I'm comfortable in performing sophisticated statistical analysis followed by contextual policy or business recommendations.

## Previously
My earlier graduate training was in econometrics and related statistical analysis technics. However, a passion for programming led me to start my career as a web developer. For about 5 years in this role, I have developed web programming skills to an expert level. You can read more about my professional experiences on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilbert-montcho">LinkedIn</a> Profile.


Underneath these technical skills, is my deep passion for Design, as Steve Job would describe it, that is not only how things look and feel but also how they work. I see in this description the culture and the structure that enable a system to work. I like to view everything in life as nested systems of which we become a collaborator, once we learn the underlying design.
